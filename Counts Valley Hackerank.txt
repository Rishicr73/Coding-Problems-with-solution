Q)Given a string of length n denoting a path with n steps, return the number of valleys in the given path.
A path is consists of U (Up) and D (Down). Assume that path starts from sea level.

- A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
- A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.

Sample Input
UDDDUDUU
Sample Output
1
Explanation

If we represent _ as sea level, a step up as / and a step down as \, path can be drawn as:

__/\      __
    \    /
     \/\/
     
There is only one valley below sea level.

Here is code
ans == 
  
n = input()
level = 0
valley = 0
for i in range(len(n)):
    if n[i] == "U":
        level += 1
    elif n[i] == "D"   :
        level -= 1
    if level == 0 and n[i] == "U"   :
    #HERE we taken this condition because when it end at sea level i.e level ==0 and its n[i] == "u"  then it will
    # have one valley for example see that diagram mention below  
        valley += 1
print(valley) 

__      __
  \    /    == this is one valley startin from level 0 to having last n[i] =="u"
   \/\/
